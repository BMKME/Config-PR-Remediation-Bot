# Config-to-PR Remediation Bot

An automated compliance remediation bot that analyzes cloud configurations, identifies misconfigurations against security baselines (CIS Benchmarks, NIST standards), and creates pull requests with remediation code.

## Features

- **Multi-format Configuration Parsing**: Supports Terraform HCL, Kubernetes YAML, and JSON configurations
- **Compliance Rule Engine**: Built-in CIS Benchmarks and NIST standards validation
- **Automated Remediation**: Generates configuration fixes and code patches
- **GitHub/GitLab Integration**: Creates pull requests with inline explanations
- **Security Hardening**: Role-based access control, secure secrets management
- **Audit Trail**: Comprehensive logging and monitoring integration

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Input Sources**: Cloud configurations (AWS Config, Terraform state, Kubernetes manifests)
2. **Analyzer Engine**: Parses configurations and runs compliance checks
3. **Remediation Generator**: Suggests fixes and generates code patches
4. **PR Bot**: Creates pull requests with remediation code and explanations
5. **Security Layer**: Input validation, RBAC, and secure secrets management
6. **Monitoring & Logging**: Audit trail and SIEM integration

## Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd config-to-pr-bot
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure environment**:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your configuration
   ```

4. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   python src/main.py
   ```

## Configuration

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure the following:

- **GitHub/GitLab tokens** for repository access
- **Vault/AWS credentials** for secrets management
- **Database connection** for audit trails
- **Logging configuration** for monitoring

## Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1-2)
- [x] Project setup and CI/CD pipeline
- [x] Terraform HCL parser implementation
- [x] Initial 10 CIS benchmark rules (AWS S3, IAM, Security Groups)

### Phase 2: Analyzer + Fixes (Week 3-4)
- [ ] Analyzer engine for misconfiguration detection
- [ ] Remediation logic for S3 public access and IAM root usage
- [ ] Comprehensive unit tests

### Phase 3: PR Bot (Week 5-6)
- [ ] GitHub App integration for PR creation
- [ ] Inline explanations for fixes
- [ ] Secure OAuth token management

### Phase 4: Security Hardening (Week 7-8)
- [ ] Role-based access control implementation
- [ ] Logging and audit trail integration
- [ ] Threat modeling and security patches

### Phase 5: Expansion (Week 9-10)
- [ ] Kubernetes manifests support
- [ ] Additional CIS rules (Networking, Encryption)
- [ ] MVP demo preparation

## Long-Term Vision

- Multi-cloud support (Azure, GCP)
- Machine learning-assisted remediation suggestions
- Marketplace for custom compliance rule packs
