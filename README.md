1. Executive Summary {#executive-summary}
The IaC Auto-Remediation Bot transforms infrastructure-as-code (IaC) security misconfigurations into automatically generated, validated, and ready-to-merge pull requests. This innovative solution moves beyond traditional security scanning by proactively fixing identified issues with safe, compliant code patches.

Key Value Proposition: Stop just flagging problems; start fixing them autonomously.

2. Problem Statement & Solution {#problem-solution}
The Problem
Traditional IaC security scanners (Checkov, Terrascan, tfsec) excel at identifying issues but leave the tedious, error-prone remediation work to already-busy engineers. This creates:

Alert fatigue from overwhelming security notifications

Increased MTTR (mean-time-to-remediation)

Security debt accumulation

Developer productivity loss

Our Solution
This bot listens to security alerts, diagnoses misconfigurations, and generates tested PRs with exact code changes needed for resolution. The solution includes:

Automated fix generation with rollback plans

Secret scanning integration

Slack/Teams workflow integration

Seamless approval processes

Result: Safer infrastructure, faster remediation, and developer freedom from repetitive security tasks.

Validation: Dry-run testing in sandbox environment

PR Creation: Automated branch and commit generation

Notification: Team alerts via preferred channels

Approval: Human review and merge decision

6. Quick Start Guide {#quick-start}
5-Minute Demo Setup
Step 1: Create Demo Repository
hcl
# s3.tf - INSECURE EXAMPLE
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "my_bucket" {
  bucket = "my-company-public-bucket"
  acl    = "public-read"   # ‚ùå INSECURE: public access enabled
}
Step 2: Bot Setup
bash
git clone https://github.com/BMKME/Config-PR-Remediation-Bot.git
cd Config-PR-Remediation-Bot
export GITHUB_TOKEN='ghp_your_token_here'
Step 3: Execute PoC
bash
python poc_s3_fixer.py --repo your-username/your-demo-repo
Expected Output
hcl
# s3.tf - FIXED BY BOT
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "my_bucket" {
  bucket = "my-company-public-bucket"
  acl    = "private"       # ‚úÖ FIXED: private bucket

  # ‚úÖ Added block public access controls
  block_public_acls   = true
  block_public_policy = true
}
